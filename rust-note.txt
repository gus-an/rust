RUST

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html

RUST IS
- expression-based language
  - statement : perform action and 'do not' return a value
    - statement cannot be assigned to a variable
    - (ex) let x = (let y = 6)
    - (ex) x = y = 6
    - statement don't evaluate to a value, which is expressed by '()', an empty tuple
  - expression : evaluate to a resulting value
    - function / macro is an expression
    - expressions do not include ending semicolons
- needs to know at compile time what 'type' a variable is
  - 'if' and 'else' block cannot have different type

RUST HAS
- strong, static type system
  - type must be known at compile time
  - four primary : integer, floating point, boolean, characters
- immutable variables as default
  - safety, easy concurrency
- snake_case as conventional style for 'function' and 'variable' names
- three kinds of loops
  - 'loop' : execute until explicitly told to stop with 'break'
    - use of 'loop' is to retry an operation you know might fail, 
      such as checking whethere a thread has completed its job
    - you can return a value when you 'break'
  - 'while' : evaluate condition within a loop
  - 'for' : execute some code for each item in a collection
    - less error prone
    - more efficient, there isn't checking condition for each loop
    - most commonly used loop construct in Rust

DEFINITIONS
- crate : packages of codes
- Cargo.lock : keeps track of exact versions of dependencies in project
  - created first time you ran 'cargo build'
  - when you build in future, Cargo will see 'Cargo.lock'
- Crates.io : where people in Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects
- trait: there are multiple traits in a crate (ex. rand::Rng, rand:Rand)
- shadowing : allows you to reuse a variable
  - creating a brand-new variable
  - use 'let' keyword again
  - different from 'mut' variables
    - has to use 'let' keyword
    - can change the type of value
- constants
  - use 'const' keyword
  - must be annotated
  - can be declared at any scope, including global
  - are valid for the entire time a program runs
  - may be set only to a contant expression (not result of a function call, or values computed at runtime)
- tuples
  - fixed length, cannot shrink or grow
- array
  - every element must have same type
  - has fixed length
  - helpful allocating data on stack (rather than heap)
    - array is single chuck of memory allocated on the stack.
- vector
  - allowed to grow or shrink
- function
  - doesn't matter where to define a function
  - parameter's 'type' must be declared
  - return value of the final expression(no semicolon) in the block of the body
    - you can return early by using 'return' keyword

CARGO INSTRUCTION
- cargo new hello_cargo
- cargo build : compile -> build exe
  - --release : compile with optimizations
    - create exe in 'target/release', not 'target/debug'
    - use for benchmarking running time
- cargo check : compiles, don't build exe
- cargo run : build and run
- cargo update : ignore 'Cargo.lock' and figure out latest ver specified in 'Cargo.toml'
- cargo doc --open : build doc provided by all your dependencies and open a browser
